libertine-scope (1.2+16.10.20160602.1-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  [ Chris Townsend ]
  * Using the "unconfined" template is strongly discouraged, so use the
    "ubuntu-scope-network" template and define read_path and write_path.
  * Use the ubuntu package namespace as canonical is used for special 3rd
    party click packages.  Also use variable substitution in the manifest.json.in
    file to match what's in the CMakefile.

  [ Kyle Nitzsche ]
  * Install ini file names and .so file to be fully qualified.

  [ Stephen M. Webb ]
  * Use new icon and logo for the Libertine Scope. Also renam "Legacy
    Applications Scope" to "XApps".
